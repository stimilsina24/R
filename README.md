# R
I will be uploading various types of bioinformatics data analysis that was performed in R. I will start out with transcriptomic(bulk and single cell RNA sequencing) analysis then move on to other types of analysis(DNA sequencing, DNA methylation, ChIP-seq, and RNA methylation). I am still in the process of learning.
