### Replicative Senescence in Human Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells
This will cover Bulk RNA sequencing analysis of gene expression changes in Human Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells following Replicative Senescence. The dataset can be found here:Â https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE171663. This section will be divided into 4 sections and cover DESeq2 data analysis, generation of differential gene expression, pathway analysis using clusterprofiler(Gene Set Enrichment Analysis and Overrepresentation Aanalysis) and visualization of data from both DESeq2 and clusterprofiler using heatmaps and other plots. I learned to perform RNA sequencing using a video series from Sanbomics (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRC406tbB8w&list=PLi1VnGoeDGjvHvl83QySD2oAQYFHPRYso&index=2). The DESeq2 analysis steps were covered in his tutorial. However, the pathway analysis had to be learned through the use of online resources and tools.
